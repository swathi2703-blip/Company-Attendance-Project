Kronos — Workforce Management (forked/prepared for deploy)

This repository contains a simple Node.js + Express + MongoDB app that serves a static frontend and exposes an API for attendance and leave management.

What I prepared for you
- Updated admin UI to list checked-in employees at the top.
- Added deployment artifacts: `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `Procfile`, and `render.yaml`.
- Added `DEPLOYMENT.md` with Render, Docker and Azure instructions.
- Added GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish a Docker image to GitHub Container Registry on push (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
